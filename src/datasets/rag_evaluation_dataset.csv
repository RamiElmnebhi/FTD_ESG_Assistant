This indicator is calculated  \nas a division which takes into account:\nFor the numerator:\n •  emissions related to the production and conversion \nof energy products used by the customers of the \nCompany;\n •  emissions related to the end use of energy products \nsold to TotalEnergies customers. For each product, \nstoichiometric emission factors1 are applied to these \nsales to obtain a quantity of emissions. Products not \nintended for combustion, such as bitumen, lubricants \nand plastics are not taken into account;\n •  less the CO2 sequestered by Carbon Capture and \nStorage (CCS) and natural carbon sinks.\nFor the denominator: \n •  the quantity of energy sold. Electricity is placed on \nan equal footing with fossil fuels, taking into account \naverage capacity factors and average efficiency ratios.\nThe carbon intensity indicator therefore corresponds to the \naverage emissions associated with each unit of energy used  \nby customers. To track changes in the indicator, it is expressed  \nin base 100 compared to 2015.\nLost Time Injury Rate (LTIR)\n  Frequency rate of lost-time injuries.\nLow-carbon hydrogen\n  Hydrogen produced from non renewable resources \nbut with greenhouse gas emissions below a maximum \nthreshold. For example, the hydrogen produced from \nnatural gas via the steam reforming process associated \nwith a capture and storage (CCS) process. In Europe, \nthe maximum threshold of greenhouse gas emission for \nlow-carbon hydrogen is the same as that for renewable \nhydrogen, i.e. 3.38 kg CO2e/kg H2 according to the \nEuropean Directive 2018/2001 named RED II.']","The provided information does not include specific details about the company's water intensity in terms of water use per million euros of revenue.
